## Core Principles

### I. Code Quality & Maintainability

All code MUST be clear, well-structured, and reviewed. Contributors MUST follow the
project's style and linting rules; where a style guide is not explicit, aim for
readability and minimal surprising behavior. Code changes MUST include unit tests
covering logic branches and edge cases. Large or risky changes MUST include a
design note explaining trade-offs and migration steps.

Rationale: High-quality, well-documented code reduces long-term maintenance
costs and makes reviews effective and fast.

### II. Test-First Discipline (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

All new features and bug fixes MUST start with failing tests: unit tests for
logic, contract tests for external interfaces, and integration tests for
cross-component behavior. Tests are first-class artifacts and MUST be merged
with the code they validate. Test suites MUST run in CI and be kept fast enough
for routine developer feedback.

Rationale: TDD ensures correctness, prevents regressions, and clarifies
requirements through executable examples.

### III. User Experience Consistency

End-user interactions (CLI, API, or UI) MUST be predictable, documented, and
consistent across the project. Public-facing behavior (flags, endpoints,
output formats) MUST maintain backward compatibility unless a documented,
versioned breaking change is proposed and approved. Error messages MUST be
actionable and surfaced with appropriate status codes or exit codes.

Rationale: Consistent UX reduces cognitive load for users and integrators and
lowers support costs.

### IV. Performance & Resource Constraints

Performance goals and resource budgets MUST be defined for features with
non-trivial operational cost. Where applicable, targets (e.g., p95 latency,
throughput, memory footprint) MUST be stated in the spec and validated by
benchmarks or load tests before release. Optimizations MUST be justified by
measurements and accompanied by regression tests.

Rationale: Early performance constraints avoid late-stage redesigns and ensure
the product meets user expectations at scale.

### V. Observability, Logging, and Diagnostics

All services and critical libraries MUST emit structured logs and metrics for
errors, key state transitions, and performance indicators. Logs MUST include
correlation identifiers where cross-cutting flows exist. Public tools MUST
provide a `--verbose` or `--debug` mode that increases diagnostic output
without changing normal behavior.

Rationale: Observability is essential for diagnosing production issues and for
measuring adherence to other principles (testing, performance).

## Additional Constraints

- Technology choices SHOULD prefer widely supported, well-maintained tooling
  and libraries. New dependencies MUST be justified in the spec with security
  and maintenance considerations.
- Security-sensitive changes MUST include threat analysis and automated checks
  where possible (e.g., static analysis, dependency scanning).
- Accessibility and internationalization are encouraged where user-facing
  features warrant them; include accessibility acceptance criteria in such
  specs.

## Development Workflow & Quality Gates

- All contributions MUST go through pull requests and at least one approval from
  a maintainer. Major changes (new public APIs, schema changes, or infra
  additions) REQUIRE a design document and two approvals.
- CI MUST run linting, unit tests, contract tests, and basic integration tests
  on every PR. Failures MUST be resolved before merging.
- Release notes for any public or versioned change MUST document behavioral
  changes, migration steps, and performance implications.

## Governance

Amendments to this constitution MUST be proposed in a pull request that:

- Explains the change and reasoning, including any compatibility impacts.
- Specifies the intended version bump (MAJOR, MINOR, PATCH) and justification.
- Includes a migration plan for any breaking changes and updates to templates
  and runtime guidance.

Constitution compliance is verified during planning (`/plan`) and enforced by
CI checks where practical. Exceptions to these principles require explicit
approval and a documented rationale in the PR.
